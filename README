This project contains scripts to convert variables in Creative Commons' website
.po files to a more general format.

Creative Commons' website is translated using gettext .po files.
For historical reasons these include variables in Python format.
This format is not supported in other programming languages.

bin/depythonize converts a Python-style "%(var)s" into a more general "%1".
It is careful to maintain the correct order for variables in translated strings.
The results are suitable for usage in php-smarty for example.

make.sh copies over those strings with Python-style variables in them (which we
assume are useful for License Chooser-style activities) and converts them.
The results are placed in po/ .

To use this code, check it out next to a checkout of

    https://github.com/creativecommons/i18n

then run make.sh from within this directory.
